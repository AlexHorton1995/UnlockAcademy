2 - What we are going to build:
    A To-Do List Application
    A Meme Generator

3.  Why React?
    Speed vs Javascript. Uses the Virtual DOM
    The Virtual DOM helps React work faster.
    Gives the ability to make usable web Components

    Reusable Web Components, and it is maintained by Facebook (whaaaaaaaaaa)

    Hirable (you can learn stuff and get hired doing React as well)

4.  ReactDOM and JSX.
    Import statement

5.  Practice - Fill in boiler plate React code required to render an unordered list to the page.  
    The list should contain 3 list items with anything in them you want.  
    Use the ReactDom.Render() method and render the unordered list.

6.  Reusable Web Components - Created a function with the markup in it, and rendered the function in the ReactDOM.
    note to self - make sure you have the open parenthesis on the same line as the return keyword, or you get errors.
    Also make sure the close parenthesis follows the value from the return as well or it throws a warning.

7.  Functional Component Practice - 
        1. Setup basic React Code from Scratch.
        2. Create a functional component called MyInfo that returns the following UI:
            a - H1 with my name
            b - Paragraph with a blurb about myself
            c - ordered or unordered list of the top 3 vacation spots to visit.
        3.  Render an instance of that functional component to the browser.
        Extra Credit
            Put some style on the page with the CSS. 

8.  Moving Components into seperate files
    a - good practice to keep components in their own files.
